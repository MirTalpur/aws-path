# AWS-Path: Automation
# Account Basics

### Goal
We will create IAM users through the UI and than automate the process except for the access key and secret keys (we will see why
we won't be automating those two user information)

Note: In order to know what to automate it's better to do it manually first and than you have a better understanding of what
you will be automating.

Start with Creating an IAM User and access and secret keys

Go to cloudformation apply:
user-group.yaml
and than
user.yaml
